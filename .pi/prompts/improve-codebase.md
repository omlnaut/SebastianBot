# Improve Codebase Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly in every suggestion. Consistent language is the point — don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation (function, class, package, slice).
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know to use the module: types, invariants, error modes, ordering, config. Not just the type signature.
- **Implementation** — the code inside.
- **Depth** — leverage at the interface: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. **Deep** = high leverage. **Shallow** = interface nearly as complex as the implementation.
- **Seam** — where an interface lives; a place behaviour can be altered without editing in place. (Use this, not "boundary.")
- **Adapter** — a concrete thing satisfying an interface at a seam.
- **Leverage** — what callers get from depth.
- **Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: change, bugs, knowledge concentrated in one place.

Key principles:

- **Deletion test**: imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.**
- **One adapter = hypothetical seam. Two adapters = real seam.**

This skill is _informed_ by the project's domain model. The domain language gives names to good seams; tickets may record decisions the skill should not re-litigate.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Read `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` and any relevant decision/history tickets in `tickets/` for the area you're touching first.

Then use the Agent tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to walk the codebase. Don't follow rigid heuristics — explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

### 2. Present candidates as an HTML report

Write a self-contained HTML file in the repository `tickets/` directory. Create `tickets/architecture-review-<timestamp>.html` so each run gets a fresh file and the report is preserved with project history. Open it for the user — `xdg-open <path>` on Linux, `open <path>` on macOS, `start <path>` on Windows — and tell them the absolute path.

The report uses **Tailwind via CDN** for layout and styling, and **Mermaid via CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals — use Mermaid when relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams, cross-sections, collapse animations). Each candidate gets a **before/after visualisation**. Be visual.

For each candidate, render a card with:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality and leverage, and how tests would improve
- **Before / After diagram** — side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength** — one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, `Speculative`, rendered as a badge

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle first and why.

**Use `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` vocabulary for the domain, and the glossary above for architecture vocabulary.** If the ubiquitous language defines "Delivery Notification," use that term consistently.

**Decision conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing decision captured in `tickets/`, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting that decision. Mark it clearly in the card (e.g. a warning callout: _"contradicts prior decision in tickets/<file>.md — but worth reopening because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor old decisions forbid.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the file is written, ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a candidate, drop into a grilling conversation. Walk the design tree with them — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`?** Add the term to `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer: _"Want me to record this as a ticket so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually help future explorers avoid repeating the same suggestion.
- **If user agrees to record it**, create `tickets/architecture-decision-<short-slug>.md` with: context, decision, consequences, and revisit trigger.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** Generate 2–3 options, compare trade-offs in locality/leverage terms, and keep grilling one branch at a time.
