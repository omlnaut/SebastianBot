# When creating a new client, follow these instructions:
- put into clients dir, each client own folder
- data that is read from an external source should always be parsed into a pydantic basemodel
    - extract models that are part of the public interface of the client in a models.py
- create a resolver in cloud/dependencies/clients.py
- create a protocol in sebastian/protocols/ defining the client's public interface
    - protocol file should be named after the client (e.g., `reddit.py` for RedditClient)
    - protocol class should be named I{ClientName} (e.g., IRedditClient)
    - include all public methods from the client
- use dependency injection for things like credentials (usually fetched via pydantic model from azure key vault)
- when creating client from an investigation, add cells showing the usage of the client
- check if it makes sense to extract private helper methods to make public methods more readable
- if a public method uses private helper methods, extract those helpers to a separate file named after the public method
    - name the file after the public method
    - create a `client` dir that contains the `client.py` and the helper files
        - the `models.py` should be at the "root" of the main client dir, not in this sub-directory
        - "export" the client in the `__init__.py` of the main client dir, so no import adjustments should be needed elsewhere
        - `client.py` should use relative imports to import the helpers
        - "main" method in the helper file should contain barely any logic, just call other private methods in the helper file to improve readability
    - keeps the main client file clean and readable
    - example: `GoogleTaskClient.create_task_with_notes()` uses helpers extracted to `create_task_with_notes.py`
    - bad example: private methods that are (or could be) used by multiple public methods should stay in the main client file. i.e. authentication, token fetching, etc.
    - good example: complex logic in `__init__` (i.e. for authentication) can be extracted to a `_login.py` helper file.
