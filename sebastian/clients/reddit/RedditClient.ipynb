Reading/writing files the wrong way – default pd.read_csv on huge files without chunksize, or writing row-by-row instead of in batches.\\n\\n4.  Too many copies of big objects – passing giant DataFrames around functions, or using .copy() everywhere when you don’t need to.\\n\\n5.  String concatenation in loops – doing result += something a million times still builds up quadratic time, even with f-strings.\\n\\n6.  Using .apply with a custom python function – basically just a disguised slow loop.\\n\\n7.  Loading way more data than you actually need – pulling in whole CSVs when you only care about a few columns.\\n\\n8.  Wrong tool for the job – using pandas for pure number crunching when NumPy would be faster, or lists when you should be using sets/dicts.\\nPretty much every slow script has 2-3 of these.

Use a proper KDF (Key Derivation Function) like\\xa0**Argon2id**\\xa0or\\xa0**PBKDF2**\\xa0with a unique salt per file to resist rainbow table attacks.\\n\\n**For Testing:**\\xa0If you built this with\\xa0`Click`\\xa0or\\xa0`Typer`, they have built-in testing runners that mock\\xa0`stdin/stdout`\\xa0beautifully.

Definitely something I’ll keep in mind as the project evolves, even if it stays in “learning tool” territory for now.\\n\\nGood call on KDFs as well!!
